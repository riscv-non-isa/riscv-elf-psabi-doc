# <a name=register-convention></a>Register Convention

Integer Register Convention <a name=integer-register-convention>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name    | ABI Mnemonic | Meaning                | Preserved across calls?
--------|--------------|------------------------|------------------------
x0      | zero         | Zero                   | -- (Immutable)
x1      | ra           | Return address         | No
x2      | sp           | Stack pointer          | Yes
x3      | gp           | Global pointer         | -- (Unallocatable)
x4      | tp           | Thread pointer         | -- (Unallocatable)
x5-x7   | t0-t2        | Temporary registers    | No
x8-x9   | s0-s1        | Callee-saved registers | Yes
x10-x17 | a0-a7        | Argument registers     | No
x18-x27 | s2-s11       | Callee-saved registers | Yes
x28-x31 | t3-t6        | Temporary registers    | No

In the standard ABI, procedures should not modify the integer registers tp and
gp, because signal handlers may rely upon their values.

The presence of a frame pointer is optional.  If a frame pointer exists
it must reside in x8 (s0), the register remains callee-saved.

Floating-point Register Convention <a name=floating-point-register-convention>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name    | ABI Mnemonic | Meaning                | Preserved across calls?
--------|--------------|------------------------|------------------------
f0-f7   | ft0-ft7      | Temporary registers    | No
f8-f9   | fs0-fs1      | Callee-saved registers | Yes*
f10-f17 | fa0-fa7      | Argument registers     | No
f18-f27 | fs2-fs11     | Callee-saved registers | Yes*
f28-f31 | ft8-ft11     | Temporary registers    | No

\*: Floating-point values in callee-saved registers are only preserved across
calls if they are no larger than the width of a floating-point register in the
targeted ABI. Therefore, these registers can always be considered temporaries
if targeting the base integer calling convention.

The Floating-Point Control and Status Register (fcsr) must have thread storage
duration in accordance with C11 section 7.6 "Floating-point environment
<fenv.h>".

# <a name=procedure-calling-convention></a>Procedure Calling Convention

## <a name=integer-calling-convention></a>Integer Calling Convention

The base integer calling convention provides eight argument registers,
a0-a7, the first two of which are also used to return values.

Scalars that are at most XLEN bits wide are passed in a single argument
register, or on the stack by value if none is available.
When passed in registers or on the stack, integer scalars narrower than XLEN
bits are widened according to the sign of their type up to 32 bits, then
sign-extended to XLEN bits.
When passed in registers or on the stack, floating-point types narrower than
XLEN bits are widened to XLEN bits, with the upper bits undefined.

Scalars that are 2&times;XLEN bits wide are passed in a pair of argument registers,
with the low-order XLEN bits in the lower-numbered register and the high-order
XLEN bits in the higher-numbered register.  If no argument registers are
available, the scalar is passed on the stack by value.  If exactly one
register is available, the low-order XLEN bits are passed in the register and
the high-order XLEN bits are passed on the stack.

Scalars wider than 2&times;XLEN are passed by reference and are replaced in the
argument list with the address.

Aggregates whose total size is no more than XLEN bits are passed in
a register, with the fields laid out as though they were passed in memory. If
no register is available, the aggregate is passed on the stack.
Aggregates whose total size is no more than 2&times;XLEN bits are passed in a pair
of registers; if only one register is available, the first half is passed in
a register and the second half is passed on the stack. If no registers are
available, the aggregate is passed on the stack. Bits unused due to
padding, and bits past the end of an aggregate whose size in bits is not
divisible by XLEN, are undefined.

Aggregates or scalars passed on the stack are aligned to the greater of the
type alignment and XLEN bits, but never more than the stack alignment.

Aggregates larger than 2&times;XLEN bits are passed by reference and are replaced in
the argument list with the address, as are C++ aggregates with nontrivial copy
constructors, destructors, or vtables.

Empty structs or union arguments or return values are ignored by C compilers
which support them as a non-standard extension.  This is not the case for C++,
which requires them to be sized types.

Bitfields are packed in little-endian fashion. A bitfield that would span the
alignment boundary of its integer type is padded to begin at the next
alignment boundary. For example, `struct { int x : 10; int y : 12; }` is
a 32-bit type with `x` in bits 9-0, `y` in bits 21-10, and bits 31-22
undefined.  By contrast, `struct { short x : 10; short y : 12; }` is a 32-bit
type with `x` in bits 9-0, `y` in bits 27-16, and bits 31-28 and 15-10
undefined.

Arguments passed by reference may be modified by the callee.

Floating-point reals are passed the same way as aggregates of the same size,
complex floating-point numbers are passed the same way as a struct containing
two floating-point reals. (This constraint changes when the integer calling 
convention is augmented by the hardware floating-point calling convention.)

In the base integer calling convention, variadic arguments are passed in the
same manner as named arguments, with one exception.  Variadic arguments with
2&times;XLEN-bit alignment and size at most 2&times;XLEN bits are passed in an
*aligned* register pair (i.e., the first register in the pair is
even-numbered), or on the stack by value if none is available. After a
variadic argument has been passed on the stack, all future arguments will also
be passed on the stack (i.e. the last argument register may be left unused due
to the aligned register pair rule).

Values are returned in the same manner as a first named argument of the same
type would be passed.  If such an argument would have been passed by
reference, the caller allocates memory for the return value, and passes the
address as an implicit first parameter.

The stack grows downwards (towards lower addresses) and the stack pointer shall
be aligned to a 128-bit boundary upon procedure entry.
The first argument passed on the stack is located at offset zero of the stack pointer
on function entry; following arguments are stored at correspondingly
higher addresses.

In the standard ABI, the stack pointer must remain
aligned throughout procedure execution. Non-standard ABI code must realign the
stack pointer prior to invoking standard ABI procedures.  The operating system
must realign the stack pointer prior to invoking a signal handler; hence,
POSIX signal handlers need not realign the stack pointer.  In systems that
service interrupts using the interruptee's stack, the interrupt service
routine must realign the stack pointer if linked with any code that uses
a non-standard stack-alignment discipline, but need not realign the stack
pointer if all code adheres to the standard ABI.

Procedures must not rely upon the persistence of
stack-allocated data whose addresses lie below the stack pointer.

Registers s0-s11 shall be preserved across procedure calls.
No floating-point registers, if present, are preserved across calls. (This 
property changes when the integer calling convention is augmented by the 
hardware floating-point calling convention.)

## <a name=hardware-floating-point-calling-convention></a>Hardware Floating-point Calling Convention

The hardware floating-point calling convention adds eight floating-point
argument registers, fa0-fa7, the first two of which are also used to return
values.  Values are passed in floating-point registers whenever possible,
whether or not the integer registers have been exhausted.

The remainder of this section applies only to named arguments.  Variadic
arguments are passed according to the integer calling convention.

For the purposes of this section, FLEN refers to the width of a floating-point
register in the ABI.  The ABI's FLEN must be no wider than the ISA's FLEN.  The
ISA might have wider floating-point registers than the ABI.

For the purposes of this section, "struct" refers to a C struct with its
hierarchy flattened, including any array fields.  That is, `struct { struct
{ float f[1]; } g[2]; }` and `struct { float f; float g; }` are
treated the same.  Fields containing empty structs or unions are ignored while
flattening, even in C++, unless they have nontrivial copy constructors or
destructors.  Fields containing zero-length bit-fields are ignored while
flattening.  Attributes such as `aligned` or `packed` do not interfere with a
struct's eligibility for being passed in registers according to the rules
below, i.e. `struct { int i; double d; }` and `struct
__attribute__((__packed__)) { int i; double d }` are treated the same, as are
`struct { float f; float g; }` and `struct { float f; float g __attribute__
((aligned (8))); }`.

A real floating-point argument is passed in a floating-point argument
register if it is no more than FLEN bits wide and at least one floating-point
argument register is available.  Otherwise, it is passed according to the
integer calling convention.
When a floating-point argument narrower than FLEN bits is passed in a
floating-point register, it is 1-extended (NaN-boxed) to FLEN bits.

A struct containing just one floating-point real is passed as though it were
a standalone floating-point real.

A struct containing two floating-point reals is passed in two floating-point
registers, if neither is more than FLEN bits wide and at least two floating-point
argument registers are available.  (The registers need not be an aligned pair.)
Otherwise, it is passed according to the integer calling convention.

A complex floating-point number, or a struct containing just one complex
floating-point number, is passed as though it were a struct containing two
floating-point reals.

A struct containing one floating-point real and one integer (or bitfield), in
either order, is passed in a floating-point register and an integer register,
without extending the integer to XLEN bits, provided the floating-point real
is no more than FLEN bits wide and the integer is no more than XLEN bits wide,
and at least one floating-point argument register and at least one integer
argument register is available. Otherwise, it is passed according to the
integer calling convention.

Unions are never flattened and are always passed according to the integer
calling convention.

Values are returned in the same manner as a first named argument of the same
type would be passed.

Floating-point registers fs0-fs11 shall be preserved across procedure calls,
provided they hold values no more than FLEN bits wide.

## <a name=ilp32e-calling-convention></a>ILP32E Calling Convention

The ILP32E calling convention is designed to be usable with the RV32E ISA. This
calling convention is the same as the integer calling convention, except for the
following differences.  The stack pointer need only be aligned to a 32-bit
boundary.  Registers x16-x31 do not participate in the calling convention, so
there are only six argument registers, a0-a5, only two callee-saved registers,
s0-s1, and only three temporaries, t0-t2.

If used with an ISA that has any of the registers x16-x31 and f0-f31, then
these registers are considered temporaries.

The ILP32E calling convention is not compatible with ISAs that have registers
that require load and store alignments of more than 32 bits. In particular, this
calling convention must not be used with the D ISA extension.

## <a name=named-abis></a>Named ABIs

This specification defines the following named ABIs:

* <a name=abi-ilp32></a>**ILP32**: Integer calling-convention only, hardware
  floating-point calling convention is not used (i.e. ELFCLASS32 and
  EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_SOFT).

* <a name=abi-ilp32f></a>**ILP32F**: ILP32 with hardware floating-point calling
  convention for FLEN=32 (i.e. ELFCLASS32 and EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_SINGLE).

* <a name=abi-ilp32d></a>**ILP32D**: ILP32 with hardware floating-point calling
  convention for FLEN=64 (i.e. ELFCLASS32 and EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_DOUBLE).

* <a name=abi-ilp32e></a>**ILP32E**: [ILP32E
  calling-convention](#ilp32e-calling-convention) only, hardware floating-point
  calling convention is not used (i.e. ELFCLASS32, EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_SOFT, and
  EF_RISCV_RVE).

* <a name=abi-lp64></a>**LP64**: Integer calling-convention only, hardware
  floating-point calling convention is not used (i.e. ELFCLASS64 and
  EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_SOFT).

* <a name=abi-lp64f></a>**LP64F**: LP64 with hardware floating-point calling
  convention for FLEN=32 (i.e. ELFCLASS64 and EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_SINGLE).

* <a name=abi-lp64d></a>**LP64D**: LP64 with hardware floating-point calling
  convention for FLEN=64 (i.e. ELFCLASS64 and EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_DOUBLE).

* <a name=abi-lp64q></a>**LP64Q**: LP64 with hardware floating-point calling
  convention for FLEN=128 (i.e. ELFCLASS64 and EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_QUAD).

The ILP32\* ABIs are only compatible with RV32\* ISAs, and the LP64\* ABIs are
only compatible with RV64\* ISAs. A future version of this specification may
define an ILP32 ABI for the RV64 ISA, but currently this is not a supported
operating mode.

The \*F ABIs require the \*F ISA extension, the \*D ABIs require the \*D ISA
extension, and the LP64Q ABI requires the Q ISA extension.

> NOTE:
> This means code targeting the Zfinx extension always uses the ILP32, ILP32E
> or LP64 integer calling-convention only ABIs as there is no dedicated
> hardware floating-point register file.

## <a name=default-abis></a>Default ABIs

While various different ABIs are technically possible, for software
compatibility reasons it is strongly recommended to use the following
default ABIs for specific architectures:

  * **on RV64G**: [LP64D](#abi-lp64d)

    Although RV64GQ systems can technically use [LP64Q](#abi-lp64q), it is
    strongly recommended to use LP64D on general-purpose RV64GQ systems for
    compatibility with standard RV64G software.

  * **on RV32G**: [ILP32D](#abi-ilp32d)

## <a name=code-models></a>Code models

The RISC-V architecture constrains the addressing of positions in the
address space.  There is no single instruction that can refer to an arbitrary 
memory position using a literal as its argument.  Rather, instructions exist
that, when combined together, can then be used to refer to a memory position
via its literal.  And, when not, other data structures are used to help the
code to address the memory space.  The coding conventions governing their use
are known as code models.

### Small

The small code model, or `medlow`, allows the code to address the whole RV32
address space or the lower 2 GiB of the RV64 address space.
By using the instructions `lui` and `ld` or `st`, when referring to an object, or
`addi`, when calculating an address literal, for example,
a 32-bit address literal can be produced.
This code model is not position independent.

### Medium

The medium code model, or `medany`, allows the code to address the range
between -2 GiB and +2 GiB from its position.  By using the instructions `auipc`
and `ld` or `st`, when referring to an object, or
`addi`, when calculating an address literal, for example,
a signed 32-bit offset, relative to the value of the `pc` register,
can be produced.
This code model is position independent.


# <a name=c-types></a>C/C++ type details

## <a name=c-type-sizes></a>C/C++ type sizes and alignments

There are two conventions for C/C++ type sizes and alignments.

  * **LP64, LP64F, LP64D, and LP64Q**: use the following type sizes and
    alignments (based on the LP64 convention):

    Type                 | Size (Bytes)  | Alignment (Bytes)
    ---------------------|---------------|------------------
    bool/_Bool           |  1            |  1
    char                 |  1            |  1
    short                |  2            |  2
    int                  |  4            |  4
    long                 |  8            |  8
    long long            |  8            |  8
    __int128             | 16            | 16
    void *               |  8            |  8
    _Float16             |  2            |  2
    float                |  4            |  4
    double               |  8            |  8
    long double          | 16            | 16
    float _Complex       |  8            |  4
    double _Complex      | 16            |  8
    long double _Complex | 32            | 16

  * **ILP32, ILP32F, ILP32D, and ILP32E**: use the following type sizes and
    alignments (based on the ILP32 convention):

    Type                 | Size (Bytes)  | Alignment (Bytes)
    ---------------------|---------------|------------------
    bool/_Bool           |  1            |  1
    char                 |  1            |  1
    short                |  2            |  2
    int                  |  4            |  4
    long                 |  4            |  4
    long long            |  8            |  8
    void *               |  4            |  4
    _Float16             |  2            |  2
    float                |  4            |  4
    double               |  8            |  8
    long double          | 16            | 16
    float _Complex       |  8            |  4
    double _Complex      | 16            |  8
    long double _Complex | 32            | 16

The alignment of `max_align_t` is 16.

`CHAR_BIT` is 8.

Structs and unions are aligned to the alignment of their most strictly aligned
member. The size of any object is a multiple of its alignment.

## <a name=c-type-representation></a>C/C++ type representations

`char` is unsigned.

Booleans (`bool`/`_Bool`) stored in memory or when being passed as scalar
arguments are either `0` (`false`) or `1` (`true`).

A null pointer (for all types) has the value zero.

`_Float16` is as defined in the C ISO/IEC TS 18661-3 extension.

`_Complex` types have the same layout as a struct containing two fields of the
corresponding real type (`float`, `double`, or `long double`), with the first
member holding the real part and the second member holding the imaginary part.

## <a name=va-list-va-start-and-va-arg></a>va_list, va_start, and va_arg

The `va_list` type is `void*`. A callee with variadic arguments is responsible
for copying the contents of registers used to pass variadic arguments to the
vararg save area, which must be contiguous with arguments passed on the stack.
The `va_start` macro initializes its `va_list` argument to point to the start
of the vararg save area.  The `va_arg` macro will increment its `va_list`
argument according to the size of the given type, taking into account the
rules about 2&times;XLEN aligned arguments being passed in "aligned" register pairs.

## <a name=c++-name-mangling></a>C++ Name Mangling

C++ name mangling for RISC-V follows the [Itanium C++ ABI](http://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/); there are no RISC-V
specific mangling rules.

See [Type encodings](http://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html#mangling-type)
for more detail on how to mangle types.

# <a name=elf-object-file></a>ELF Object Files

## <a name=file-header></a>File Header

* e_ident
  * EI_CLASS: Specifies the base ISA, either RV32 or RV64.  We don't let users
    link RV32 and RV64 code together.
    * ELFCLASS64: ELF-64 Object File
    * ELFCLASS32: ELF-32 Object File

* e_type: Nothing RISC-V specific.

* e_machine: Identifies the machine this ELF file targets.  Always contains
  EM_RISCV (243) for RISC-V ELF files.  We only support RISC-V v2 family ISAs,
  this support is implicit.

* e_flags: Describes the format of this ELF file.  These flags are used by the
  linker to disallow linking ELF files with incompatible ABIs together.

   Bit 0 | Bit  1 - 2 | Bit 3 | Bit 4 | Bit 5 - 31
  -------|------------|-------|-------|------------
   RVC   | Float ABI  |  RVE  |  TSO  | *Reserved*

  * EF_RISCV_RVC (0x0001): This bit is set when the binary targets the C ABI,
    which allows instructions to be aligned to 16-bit boundaries (the base RV32
    and RV64 ISAs only allow 32-bit instruction alignment).  When linking
    objects which specify EF_RISCV_RVC, the linker is permitted to use RVC
    instructions such as C.JAL in the relaxation process.
  * EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_SOFT (0x0000)
  * EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_SINGLE (0x0002)
  * EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_DOUBLE (0x0004)
  * EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_QUAD (0x0006): These flags identify the floating point
    ABI in use for this ELF file.  They store the largest floating-point type
    that ends up in registers as part of the ABI (but do not control if code
    generation is allowed to use floating-point internally).  The rule is that
    if you have a floating-point type in a register, then you also have all
    smaller floating-point types in registers.  For example \_DOUBLE would
    store "float" and "double" values in F registers, but would not store "long
    double" values in F registers.  If none of the float ABI flags are set, the
    object is taken to use the soft-float ABI.
  * EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI (0x0006): This macro is used as a mask to test for one
    of the above floating-point ABIs, e.g.,
    `(e_flags & EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI) == EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_DOUBLE`.
  * EF_RISCV_RVE (0x0008): This bit is set when the binary targets the E ABI.
  * EF_RISCV_TSO (0x0010): This bit is set when the binary requires the RVTSO
    memory consistency model.

  Until such a time that the *Reserved* bits (0xffffffe0) are allocated by
  future versions of this specification, they shall not be set by standard

RISC-V is a classical RISC architecture that has densely packed non-word
sized instruction immediate values. While the linker can make relocations on
arbitrary memory locations, many of the RISC-V relocations are designed for
use with specific instructions or instruction sequences. RISC-V has several
instruction specific encodings for PC-Relative address loading, jumps,
branches and the RVC compressed instruction set.

The purpose of this section is to describe the RISC-V specific instruction
sequences with their associated relocations in addition to the general purpose
machine word sized relocations that are used for symbol addresses in the
Global Offset Table or DWARF meta data.

The following table provides details of the RISC-V ELF relocations (instruction
specific relocations show the instruction type in the Details column):

This section and later ones contain fragments written in assembler. The precise
assembler syntax, including that of the relocations, is described in the
[RISC-V Assembly Programmer's Manual](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-asm-manual).

### Calculation Symbols

The following table provides details on the variables used in relocation
calculation:

Variable  | Description
:-------  | :----------------
A         | Addend field in the relocation entry associated with the symbol
B         | Base address of a shared object loaded into memory
G         | Offset of the symbol into the GOT (Global Offset Table)
P         | Position of the relocation
S         | Value of the symbol in the symbol table
V         | Value at the position of the relocation
GP        | Value of `__global_pointer$` symbol
TLSMODULE | TLS module index for the object containing the symbol
TLSOFFSET | TLS static block offset (relative to `tp`) for the object containing the symbol

**Global Pointer**: It is assumed that program startup code will load the value
of the `__global_pointer$` symbol into register `gp` (aka `x3`).

### Field Symbols

The following table provides details on the variables used in relocation fields:

Variable    | Description
:-------    | :----------
_word6_     | Specifies the 6 least significant bits of a _word8_ field
_word8_     | Specifies an 8-bit word
_word16_    | Specifies a 16-bit word
_word32_    | Specifies a 32-bit word
_word64_    | Specifies a 64-bit word
_wordclass_ | Specifies a _word32_ field for ILP32 or a _word64_ field for LP64
_B-Type_    | Specifies a field as the immediate field in a B-type instruction
_CB-Type_   | Specifies a field as the immediate field in a CB-type instruction

_CJ-Type_   | Specifies a field as the immediate field in a CJ-type instruction
_I-Type_    | Specifies a field as the immediate field in an I-type instruction
_S-Type_    | Specifies a field as the immediate field in an S-type instruction
_U-Type_    | Specifies a field as the immediate field in an U-type instruction
_J-Type_    | Specifies a field as the immediate field in a J-type instruction
_U+J-Type_  | Specifies a field as the immediate fields in a U-type and J-type instruction pair

### Constants

The following table provides details on the constants used in relocation fields:

Name           | Value
:---           | :----
TLS_DTV_OFFSET | 0x800

### Absolute Addresses

32-bit absolute addresses in position dependent code are loaded with a pair
of instructions which have an associated pair of relocations:
`R_RISCV_HI20` plus `R_RISCV_LO12_I` or `R_RISCV_LO12_S`.

The `R_RISCV_HI20` refers to an `LUI` instruction containing the high
20-bits to be relocated to an absolute symbol address. The `LUI` instruction
is followed by an I-Type instruction (add immediate or load) with an
`R_RISCV_LO12_I` relocation or an S-Type instruction (store) and an
`R_RISCV_LO12_S` relocation. The addresses for pair of relocations are
calculated like this:

 - `hi20 = ((symbol_address + 0x800) >> 12);`
 - `lo12 = symbol_address - (hi20 << 12);`

The following assembly and relocations show loading an absolute address:

```
     lui  a0,%hi(symbol)     # R_RISCV_HI20 (symbol)
     addi a0,a0,%lo(symbol)  # R_RISCV_LO12_I (symbol)
```

**GP-Relative Relocations**: If `symbol` is within the range of a signed 12-bit
immediate offset from `__global_pointer$`, then the address can be loaded with a
single instruction which has one relocation, a `R_RISCV_GPREL_I` or
`R_RISCV_GPREL_S`.

The instruction is an I-Type instruction (add immediate or load) with an
`R_RISCV_GPREL_I` or an S-type instruction (store) with an `R_RISCV_GPREL_S`
relocation. The following assembly show loading a gp-relative address:

```
     addi a0, gp, 0          # R_RISCV_GPREL_I (symbol)
```

This relies on the value of `__global_pointer$` being loaded into `gp` (aka
`x3`). This can be used by linker relaxation to delete the `lui` instruction.

### Global Offset Table

For position independent code in dynamically linked objects, each shared
object contains a GOT (Global Offset Table) which contains addresses of
global symbols (objects and functions) referred to by the dynamically
linked shared object. The GOT in each shared library is filled in by the
dynamic linker during program loading, or on the first call to extern functions.

To avoid runtime relocations within the text segment of position independent
code the GOT is used for indirection. Instead of code loading virtual addresses
directly, as can be done in static code, addresses are loaded from the GOT.
This allows runtime binding to external objects and functions at the expense of
a slightly higher runtime overhead for access to extern objects and functions.

### Program Linkage Table

The PLT (Program Linkage Table) exists to allow function calls between
dynamically linked shared objects. Each dynamic object has its own
GOT (Global Offset Table) and PLT (Program Linkage Table).

The first entry of a shared object PLT is a special entry that calls
`_dl_runtime_resolve` to resolve the GOT offset for the called function.
The `_dl_runtime_resolve` function in the dynamic loader resolves the
GOT offsets lazily on the first call to any function, except when
`LD_BIND_NOW` is set in which case the GOT entries are populated by the
dynamic linker before the executable is started. Lazy resolution of GOT
entries is intended to speed up program loading by deferring symbol
resolution to the first time the function is called. The first entry
in the PLT occupies two 16 byte entries:

```
1:   auipc  t2, %pcrel_hi(.got.plt)
     sub    t1, t1, t3               # shifted .got.plt offset + hdr size + 12
     l[w|d] t3, %pcrel_lo(1b)(t2)    # _dl_runtime_resolve
     addi   t1, t1, -(hdr size + 12) # shifted .got.plt offset
     addi   t0, t2, %pcrel_lo(1b)    # &.got.plt
     srli   t1, t1, log2(16/PTRSIZE) # .got.plt offset
     l[w|d] t0, PTRSIZE(t0)          # link map
     jr     t3
```

Subsequent function entry stubs in the PLT take up 16 bytes and load a
function pointer from the GOT. On the first call to a function, the
entry redirects to the first PLT entry which calls `_dl_runtime_resolve`
and fills in the GOT entry for subsequent calls to the function:

```
1:  auipc   t3, %pcrel_hi(function@.got.plt)
    l[w|d]  t3, %pcrel_lo(1b)(t3)
    jalr    t1, t3
    nop
```

### Procedure Calls

`R_RISCV_CALL` and `R_RISCV_CALL_PLT` relocations are associated with
pairs of instructions (`AUIPC+JALR`) generated by the `CALL` or `TAIL`
pseudoinstructions.  Originally, these relocations had slightly different
behavior, but that has turned out to be unnecessary, and they are now
interchangeable.

In position dependent code (`-fno-pic`), with relaxation enabled,
the `AUIPC` instruction in the
`AUIPC+JALR` pair has both a `R_RISCV_CALL` relocation and a `R_RISCV_RELAX`
relocation indicating the instruction sequence can be relaxed during linking.

In position independent code (`-fPIC`, `-fpic` or `-fpie`),
with relaxation enabled, the `AUIPC`
instruction in the `AUIPC+JALR` pair has both a `R_RISCV_CALL_PLT` relocation
and a `R_RISCV_RELAX` relocation indicating the instruction sequence can be
relaxed during linking.

Procedure call linker relaxation allows the `AUIPC+JALR` pair to be relaxed
to the `JAL` instruction when the procedure or PLT entry is within (-1MiB to
+1MiB-2) of the instruction pair.

The pseudoinstruction:

```
    call symbol
```

expands to the following assembly and relocation:

```
    auipc ra, 0           # R_RISCV_CALL (symbol), R_RISCV_RELAX (symbol)
    jalr  ra, ra, 0
```

and when `-fpic` is enabled it expands to:

```
    auipc ra, 0           # R_RISCV_CALL_PLT (symbol), R_RISCV_RELAX (symbol)
    jalr  ra, ra, 0
```

### PC-Relative Jumps and Branches

Unconditional jump (U+J-Type) instructions have a `R_RISCV_JAL` relocation
that can represent an even signed 21-bit offset (-1MiB to +1MiB-2).

Branch (SB-Type) instructions have a `R_RISCV_BRANCH` relocation that
can represent an even signed 13-bit offset (-4096 to +4094).

### PC-Relative Symbol Addresses

32-bit PC-relative relocations for symbol addresses on sequences of
instructions such as the `AUIPC+ADDI` instruction pair expanded from
the `la` pseudoinstruction, in position independent code typically
have an associated pair of relocations: `R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20` plus
`R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I` or `R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_S`.

The `R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20` relocation refers to an `AUIPC` instruction
containing the high 20-bits to be relocated to a symbol relative to the
program counter address of the `AUIPC` instruction. The `AUIPC`
instruction is followed by an I-Type instruction (add immediate or load)
with an `R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I` relocation or an S-Type instruction (store)
and an `R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_S` relocation.

The `R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I` or `R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_S` relocations contain
a label pointing to an instruction in the same section with an
`R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20` relocation entry that points to the target symbol:

 - At label: `R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20` relocation entry &rarr; symbol
 - `R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I` relocation entry &rarr; label

To get the symbol address to perform the calculation to fill the 12-bit
immediate on the add, load or store instruction the linker finds the
`R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20` relocation entry associated with the `AUIPC`
instruction. The addresses for pair of relocations are calculated like this:

 - `hi20 = ((symbol_address - hi20_reloc_offset + 0x800) >> 12);`
 - `lo12 = symbol_address - hi20_reloc_offset - (hi20 << 12);`

The successive instruction has a signed 12-bit immediate so the value of the
preceding high 20-bit relocation may have 1 added to it.

Note the compiler emitted instructions for PC-relative symbol addresses are
not necessarily sequential or in pairs. There is a constraint is that the
instruction with the `R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I` or `R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_S`
relocation label points to a valid HI20 PC-relative relocation pointing to
the symbol.

Here is example assembler showing the relocation types:

```
label:
   auipc t0, %pcrel_hi(symbol)   # R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20 (symbol)
   lui t1, 1
   lw t2, t0, %pcrel_lo(label)   # R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I (label)
   add t2, t2, t1
   sw t2, t0, %pcrel_lo(label)   # R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_S (label)
```

## <a name=thread-local-storage></a>Thread Local Storage

RISC-V adopts the ELF Thread Local Storage Model in which ELF objects define
`.tbss` and `.tdata` sections and `PT_TLS` program headers that contain the
TLS "initialization images" for new threads. The `.tbss` and `.tdata` sections
are not referenced directly like regular segments, rather they are copied or
allocated to the thread local storage space of newly created threads.
See [https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/tls.pdf](https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/tls.pdf).

In The ELF Thread Local Storage Model, TLS offsets are used instead of pointers.
The ELF TLS sections are initialization images for the thread local variables of
each new thread. A TLS offset defines an offset into the dynamic thread vector
which is pointed to by the TCB (Thread Control Block). RISC-V uses Variant I as
described by the ELF TLS specification, with `tp` containing the address one
past the end of the TCB.

There are various thread local storage models for statically allocated or
dynamically allocated thread local storage. The following table lists the
thread local storage models:

Mnemonic | Model          | Compiler flags
:------- | :---------     | :-------------------
TLS LE   | Local Exec     | `-ftls-model=local-exec`
TLS IE   | Initial Exec   | `-ftls-model=initial-exec`
TLS LD   | Local Dynamic  | `-ftls-model=local-dynamic`
TLS GD   | Global Dynamic | `-ftls-model=global-dynamic`

The program linker in the case of static TLS or the dynamic linker in the case
of dynamic TLS allocate TLS offsets for storage of thread local variables.

### Local Exec

Local exec is a form of static thread local storage. This model is used
when static linking as the TLS offsets are resolved during program linking.

- Compiler flag `-ftls-model=local-exec`
- Variable attribute: `__thread int i __attribute__((tls_model("local-exec")));`

Example assembler load and store of a thread local variable `i` using the
`%tprel_hi`, `%tprel_add` and `%tprel_lo` assembler functions. The emitted
relocations are in comments.

```
  lui  a5,%tprel_hi(i)           # R_RISCV_TPREL_HI20 (symbol)
  add  a5,a5,tp,%tprel_add(i)    # R_RISCV_TPREL_ADD (symbol)
  lw   t0,%tprel_lo(i)(a5)       # R_RISCV_TPREL_LO12_I (symbol)
  addi t0,t0,1
  sw   t0,%tprel_lo(i)(a5)       # R_RISCV_TPREL_LO12_S (symbol)
```

The `%tprel_add` assembler function does not return a value and is used purely
to associate the `R_RISCV_TPREL_ADD` relocation with the `add` instruction.

### Initial Exec

Initial exec is is a form of static thread local storage that can be used in
shared libraries that use thread local storage. TLS relocations are performed
at load time. `dlopen` calls to libraries that use thread local storage may fail
when using the initial exec thread local storage model as TLS offsets must all
be resolved at load time. This model uses the GOT to resolve TLS offsets.

- Compiler flag `-ftls-model=initial-exec`
- Variable attribute: `__thread int i __attribute__((tls_model("initial-exec")));`
- ELF flags: DF_STATIC_TLS

Example assembler load and store of a thread local variable `i` using the
`la.tls.ie` pseudoinstruction, with the emitted TLS relocations in comments:

```
   la.tls.ie a5,i
   add  a5,a5,tp
   lw   t0,0(a5)
   addi t0,t0,1
   sw   t0,0(a5)
```

The assembler pseudoinstruction:

```
   la.tls.ie a5,symbol
```

expands to the following assembly instructions and relocations:

```
label:
   auipc a5, 0                   # R_RISCV_TLS_GOT_HI20 (symbol)
   {ld,lw} a5, 0(a5)             # R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I (label)
```

### Global Dynamic

RISC-V local dynamic and global dynamic TLS models generate equivalent object code.
The Global dynamic thread local storage model is used for PIC Shared libraries and
handles the case where more than one library uses thread local variables, and
additionally allows libraries to be loaded and unloaded at runtime using `dlopen`.
In the global dynamic model, application code calls the dynamic linker function
`__tls_get_addr` to locate TLS offsets into the dynamic thread vector at runtime.

- Compiler flag `-ftls-model=global-dynamic`
- Variable attribute: `__thread int i __attribute__((tls_model("global-dynamic")));`

Example assembler load and store of a thread local variable `i` using the
`la.tls.gd` pseudoinstruction, with the emitted TLS relocations in comments:

```
  la.tls.gd a0,i
  call  __tls_get_addr@plt
  mv   a5,a0
  lw   t0,0(a5)
  addi t0,t0,1
  sw   t0,0(a5)
```

The assembler pseudoinstruction:

```
   la.tls.gd a0,symbol
```

expands to the following assembly instructions and relocations:

```
label:
   auipc a0,0                    # R_RISCV_TLS_GD_HI20 (symbol)
   addi  a0,a0,0                 # R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I (label)
```

In the Global Dynamic model, the runtime library provides the `__tls_get_addr` function:

```
extern void *__tls_get_addr (tls_index *ti);
```

where the type tls index are defined as:

```
typedef struct
{
  unsigned long int ti_module;
  unsigned long int ti_offset;
} tls_index;
```

## <a name=Attributes></a>Attributes

Attributes are used to record information about an object file/binary that a
linker or runtime loader needs to check compatibility.

Attributes are encoded in a vendor-specific section of type SHT_RISCV_ATTRIBUTES
and name .riscv.attributes. The value of an attribute can hold an integer
encoded in the uleb128 format or a null-terminated byte string (NTBS).

RISC-V attributes have a string value if the tag number is odd and an integer
value if the tag number is even.

### Detailed attribute description

#### How does this specification describe public attributes?

Each attribute is described in the following structure:
`<Tag name>, <Value>, <Parameter type 1>=<Parameter name 1>[, <Parameter type 2>=<Parameter name 2>]`

#### Tag_RISCV_stack_align, 4, uleb128=value
Tag_RISCV_strict_align records the N-byte stack alignment for this object. The
default value is 16 for RV32I or RV64I, and 4 for RV32E.

It will report erros if link object files with different Tag_RISCV_stack_align values.

#### Tag_RISCV_arch, 5, NTBS=subarch
Tag_RISCV_arch contains a string for the target architecture taken from
the option `-march`. Different architectures will be integrated into a superset
when object files are merged.

Note that the version information for target architecture must be presented
explicitly in the attribute and abbreviations must be expanded. The version
information, if not given by `-march`, must agree with the default
specified by the tool. For example, the architecture `RV32I` has to be recorded
in the attribute as `RV32I2P0` in which `2P0` stands for the default version of
its based ISA. On the other hand, the architecture `RV32G` has to be presented
as `RV32I2P0_M2P0_A2P0_F2P0_D2P0` in which the abbreviation `G` is expanded
to the IMAFD combination with default versions of the standard extensions.

#### Tag_RISCV_unaligned_access, 6, uleb128=value
Tag_RISCV_unaligned_access denotes the code generation policy for this object
file. Its values are defined as follows:
 - 0: This object does not perform any unaligned memory accesses.
 - 1: This object may perform unaligned memory accesses.

#### Tag_RISCV_priv_spec, 8, uleb128=version
#### Tag_RISCV_priv_spec_minor, 10, uleb128=version
#### Tag_RISCV_priv_spec_revision, 12, uleb128=version

Tag_RISCV_priv_spec contains the major/minor/revision version information of
the privileged specification. It will report errors if object files of different
privileged specification versions are merged.

# <a name=dwarf></a>DWARF

Dwarf Register Numbers <a name=dwarf-register-numbers>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dwarf Number  | Register Name | Description
--------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------
0-31          | x0-x31        | Integer Registers
32-63         | f0-f31        | Floating-point Registers
64            |               | Alternate Frame Return Column
65-95         |               | Reserved for future standard extensions
96-127        | v0-v31        | Vector Registers
128 - 3071    |               | Reserved for future standard extensions
3072 - 4095   |               | Reserved for custom extensions
4096 - 8191   |               | CSRs

The alternate frame return column is meant to be used when unwinding from
signal handlers, and stores the address where the signal handler will return
to.

There space for 4096 CSRs.  Each CSR is assigned a DWARF register
number corresponding to its CSR number given in **Volume II: Privileged
Architecture** of **The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual** plus 4096.

# <a name=linux-abi></a>Linux-specific ABI

**This section of the RISC-V ELF psABI specification only applies to Linux-based
systems.**

In order to ensure compatibility between different implementations of the C
library for Linux, we provide some extra definitions which only apply on those
systems. These are noted in this section.

## <a name=linux-c-type-sizes></a>Linux-specific C type sizes and alignments

The following definitions apply for all ABIs defined in this document. Here
there is no differentiation between ILP32 and LP64 abis.

Type        | Size (Bytes)  | Alignment (Bytes)
------------|---------------|------------------
wchar_t     |  4            |  4
wint_t      |  4            |  4

## <a name=linux-c-type-representations></a>Linux-specific C type representations

The following definitions apply for all ABIs defined in this document. Here
there is no differentiation between ILP32 and LP64 abis.

`wchar_t` is signed.  `wint_t` is unsigned.

# <a name=code-relax></a>Code relaxation

At link time, when all the memory objects have been resolved, the code sequence
used to refer to them may be simplified and optimized by the linker by relaxing
some assumptions about the memory layout made at compile time.

Some relocation types, in certain situations, indicate to the linker where this
can happen.  Additionally, some relocation types indicate to the
linker the associated parts of a code sequence that can be thusly simplified,
rather than to instruct the linker how to apply a relocation.

The linker should only perform such relaxations when a R_RISCV_RELAX relocation
is at the same position as a candidate relocation.
