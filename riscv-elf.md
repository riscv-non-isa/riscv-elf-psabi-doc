# Overview of an ELF file

# Data Representation

# File Header

* e_ident
  * EI_CLASS: Specifies the base ISA, either RV32 ond RV64.  We don't let users
    link RV32 and RV64 code together.
    * ELFCLASS64: ELF-64 Object File
    * ELFCLASS32: ELF-32 Object File

* e_type: Nothing RISC-V specific.

* e_machine: Identifies the machine this ELF file targets.  Always contains
  EM_RISCV (243) for RISC-V ELF files.  We only support RISC-V v2 family ISAs,
  this support is implicit.

* e_flags: Describes the format of this ELF file.  These flags are used by the
  linker to disallow linking ELF files with incompatible ABIs together.

   Bit 0 | Bit  1 - 2 | Bit 3 | Bit 4 - 31
  -------|------------|-------|------------
   RVC   | Float ABI  |  RVE  | UNUSED


  * EF_RISCV_RVC (0x0001): This bit is set when the binary targets the C ABI,
    which allows instructions to be aligned to 16-bit boundries (the base RV32
    and RV64 ISAs only allow 32-bit instruction alignment).  When linking
    objects which specify EF_RISCV_RVC, the linker is permitted to use RVC
    instructions such as C.JAL in the relaxation process.
  * EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_SINGLE (0x0002)
  * EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_DOUBLE (0x0004)
  * EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_QUAD (0x0006): These three flags identify the floating
    point ABI in use for this ELF file.  They store the largest floating-point
    type that ends up in registers as part of the ABI (but do not control if
    code generation is allowed to use floating-point internally).  The rule is
    that if you have a floating-point type in a register, then you also have
    all smaller floating-point types in registers.  For example _DOUBLE would
    store "float" and "double" values in F registers, but would not store "long
    double" values in F registers.  If none of the float ABI flags are set, the
    object is taken to use the soft-float ABI.
  * EF_RISCV_RVE (0x0008): This bit is set when the binary targets the E ABI.
