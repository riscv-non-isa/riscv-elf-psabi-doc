== Android-specific ABI

NOTE: This section of the RISC-V calling convention specification only applies
to Android-based systems.

The Android ABIs do not have a global pointer register, along with the
GP-related relocations and relaxations.  `x3` is instead used for the software
shadow call stack, with an ABI name of `sscs`.
