== DWARF Debugging Format

The DWARF debugging format for RISC-V follows the
https://dwarfstd.org/[standard DWARF specification]; this specification only
describes RISC-V-specific definitions.

== DWARF Register Numbers

The table below lists the mapping from DWARF register numbers to machine
registers.

| DWARF Number | Register Name | Description

| 0 - 31       | x0 - x31      | Integer Registers
| 32 - 63      | f0 - f31      | Floating-point Registers
| 64           |               | Alternate Frame Return Column
| 65 - 95      |               | Reserved for future standard extensions
| 96 - 127     | v0 - v31      | Vector Registers
| 128 - 3071   |               | Reserved for future standard extensions
| 3072 - 4095  |               | Reserved for custom extensions
| 4096 - 8191  |               | CSRs
|===

The alternate frame return column is meant to be used when unwinding from
signal handlers, and stores the address where the signal handler will return
to.

The RISC-V specification defines a total of 4096 CSRs (see <<riscv-priv>>).
Each CSR is assigned a DWARF register number corresponding to its specified CSR
number plus 4096.
