= Introduction

:sectnums!:

This specification provides the processor-specific application binary interface
document for RISC-V.

This specification consists of the following three parts:

- Calling convention
- ELF specification
- DWARF specification

A future revision of this ABI will include a canonical set of mappings for
memory model synchronization primitives.

NOTE: This specification now includes preliminary support for big-endian ABIs.
Big-endian support has been implemented in GNU GCC and LLVM/Clang toolchains.
The big-endian variants follow the same calling conventions as their
little-endian counterparts, with only the data byte ordering differing.

Any encodings that are marked as reserved for a specific extension (ISA or
purely ABI addition) should be treated by standard tools identically to any
other encodings reserved for future standard extensions. Such reservations are
solely declarations of intent to reduce conflicts between in-flight standard
extensions, and may be reclaimed for future reassignment at any point for any
reason. Any encodings marked as reserved have draft, not ratified, status,
regardless of whether they are reserved for a ratified ISA extension.
