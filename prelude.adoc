// These are the definitions from docs-template:
//
//   development: Assume everything can change
//   stable: Assume everything could change
//   frozen: If you implement this version you assume the risk that something
//           might change because of the public review cycle but we expect
//           little to no change.
//   ratified: You can implement this and be assured nothing will change. If
//             something needs to change due to an errata or enhancement, it
//             will come out in a new extension. we do not revise extensions.
//
// These don't really make sense for our development process, so we replace
// development with a single dev version that we brand as Pre-release, but
// anything featuring in the document is implicitly frozen (in fact, stronger,
// as frozen can still change in incompatible ways) as we cannot break ABI once
// features are implemented in toolchains. Similarly stable is still frozen
// just by another name for policy reasons.
