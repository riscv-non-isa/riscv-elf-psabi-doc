| Name    | ABI Mnemonic | Meaning                | Preserved across calls?

| x0      | zero         | Zero                   | -- (Immutable)
| x1      | ra           | Return address         | No
| x2      | sp           | Stack pointer          | Yes
| x3      | gp           | Global pointer         | -- (Unallocatable)

| x28-x31 | t3-t6        | Temporary registers    | No
|===

In the standard ABI, procedures should not modify the integer registers tp and
gp, because signal handlers may rely upon their values.

The presence of a frame pointer is optional.  If a frame pointer exists
it must reside in x8 (s0), the register remains callee-saved.

=== Floating-point Register Convention

[%autowidth]
|===
| Name    | ABI Mnemonic | Meaning                | Preserved across calls?

| f0-f7   | ft0-ft7      | Temporary registers    | No
| f8-f9   | fs0-fs1      | Callee-saved registers | Yes*
| f10-f17 | fa0-fa7      | Argument registers     | No
| f18-f27 | fs2-fs11     | Callee-saved registers | Yes*
| f28-f31 | ft8-ft11     | Temporary registers    | No
|===

*: Floating-point values in callee-saved registers are only preserved across
calls if they are no larger than the width of a floating-point register in the
targeted ABI. Therefore, these registers can always be considered temporaries
if targeting the base integer calling convention.

The Floating-Point Control and Status Register (fcsr) must have thread storage
duration in accordance with C11 section 7.6 "Floating-point environment
<fenv.h>".

=== Vector Register Convention

| Name    | ABI Mnemonic | Meaning                      | Preserved across calls?

|v0       |              | Argument register for mask*  | No
|v1-v7    |              | Temporary registers          | No
|v8-v23   |              | Argument registers           | No

|vtype    |              | Vector data type register    | No
|===

*: v0 is used as the mask register for masked vector instructions. It is also
used as the first mask argument in the procedure calling convention. If there
is no need to use it as the mask, it can be considered a temporary register.

== Procedure Calling Convention

=== Integer Calling Convention

The base integer calling convention provides eight argument registers,
a0-a7, the first two of which are also used to return values.

Scalars that are at most XLEN bits wide are passed in a single argument
register, or on the stack by value if none is available.
When passed in registers or on the stack, integer scalars narrower than XLEN
bits are widened according to the sign of their type up to 32 bits, then
sign-extended to XLEN bits.
When passed in registers or on the stack, floating-point types narrower than
XLEN bits are widened to XLEN bits, with the upper bits undefined.

Scalars that are 2×XLEN bits wide are passed in a pair of argument registers,
with the low-order XLEN bits in the lower-numbered register and the high-order
XLEN bits in the higher-numbered register.  If no argument registers are
available, the scalar is passed on the stack by value.  If exactly one
register is available, the low-order XLEN bits are passed in the register and
the high-order XLEN bits are passed on the stack.

Scalars wider than 2×XLEN are passed by reference and are replaced in the
argument list with the address.

Aggregates whose total size is no more than XLEN bits are passed in
a register, with the fields laid out as though they were passed in memory. If
no register is available, the aggregate is passed on the stack.
Aggregates whose total size is no more than 2×XLEN bits are passed in a pair
of registers; if only one register is available, the first half is passed in
a register and the second half is passed on the stack. If no registers are
available, the aggregate is passed on the stack. Bits unused due to
padding, and bits past the end of an aggregate whose size in bits is not
divisible by XLEN, are undefined.

Aggregates or scalars passed on the stack are aligned to the greater of the
type alignment and XLEN bits, but never more than the stack alignment.

Aggregates larger than 2×XLEN bits are passed by reference and are replaced in
the argument list with the address, as are C++ aggregates with nontrivial copy
constructors, destructors, or vtables.

Empty structs or union arguments or return values are ignored by C compilers
which support them as a non-standard extension.  This is not the case for C++,
which requires them to be sized types.

Bitfields are packed in little-endian fashion. A bitfield that would span the
alignment boundary of its integer type is padded to begin at the next
alignment boundary. For example, `struct { int x : 10; int y : 12; }` is
a 32-bit type with `x` in bits 9-0, `y` in bits 21-10, and bits 31-22
undefined.  By contrast, `struct { short x : 10; short y : 12; }` is a 32-bit
type with `x` in bits 9-0, `y` in bits 27-16, and bits 31-28 and 15-10
undefined.

Arguments passed by reference may be modified by the callee.

Floating-point reals are passed the same way as aggregates of the same size,
complex floating-point numbers are passed the same way as a struct containing
two floating-point reals. (This constraint changes when the integer calling
convention is augmented by the hardware floating-point calling convention.)

In the base integer calling convention, variadic arguments are passed in the
same manner as named arguments, with one exception.  Variadic arguments with
2×XLEN-bit alignment and size at most 2×XLEN bits are passed in an
*aligned* register pair (i.e., the first register in the pair is
even-numbered), or on the stack by value if none is available. After a
variadic argument has been passed on the stack, all future arguments will also
be passed on the stack (i.e. the last argument register may be left unused due
to the aligned register pair rule).

Values are returned in the same manner as a first named argument of the same
type would be passed.  If such an argument would have been passed by
reference, the caller allocates memory for the return value, and passes the
address as an implicit first parameter.

The stack grows downwards (towards lower addresses) and the stack pointer shall
be aligned to a 128-bit boundary upon procedure entry.
The first argument passed on the stack is located at offset zero of the stack pointer
on function entry; following arguments are stored at correspondingly
higher addresses.

In the standard ABI, the stack pointer must remain
aligned throughout procedure execution. Non-standard ABI code must realign the
stack pointer prior to invoking standard ABI procedures.  The operating system
must realign the stack pointer prior to invoking a signal handler; hence,
POSIX signal handlers need not realign the stack pointer.  In systems that
service interrupts using the interruptee's stack, the interrupt service
routine must realign the stack pointer if linked with any code that uses
a non-standard stack-alignment discipline, but need not realign the stack
pointer if all code adheres to the standard ABI.

Procedures must not rely upon the persistence of
stack-allocated data whose addresses lie below the stack pointer.

Registers s0-s11 shall be preserved across procedure calls.
No floating-point registers, if present, are preserved across calls. (This
property changes when the integer calling convention is augmented by the
hardware floating-point calling convention.)

=== Hardware Floating-point Calling Convention

The hardware floating-point calling convention adds eight floating-point
argument registers, fa0-fa7, the first two of which are also used to return
values.  Values are passed in floating-point registers whenever possible,
whether or not the integer registers have been exhausted.

The remainder of this section applies only to named arguments.  Variadic
arguments are passed according to the integer calling convention.

For the purposes of this section, FLEN refers to the width of a floating-point
register in the ABI.  The ABI's FLEN must be no wider than the ISA's FLEN.  The
ISA might have wider floating-point registers than the ABI.

For the purposes of this section, "struct" refers to a C struct with its
hierarchy flattened, including any array fields.  That is, `struct { struct
{ float f[1]; } g[2]; }` and `struct { float f; float g; }` are
treated the same.  Fields containing empty structs or unions are ignored while
flattening, even in C++, unless they have nontrivial copy constructors or
destructors.  Fields containing zero-length bit-fields are ignored while
flattening.  Attributes such as `aligned` or `packed` do not interfere with a
struct's eligibility for being passed in registers according to the rules
below, i.e. `struct { int i; double d; }` and `struct
__attribute__((__packed__)) { int i; double d }` are treated the same, as are
`struct { float f; float g; }` and `struct { float f; float g __attribute__
((aligned (8))); }`.

A real floating-point argument is passed in a floating-point argument
register if it is no more than FLEN bits wide and at least one floating-point
argument register is available.  Otherwise, it is passed according to the
integer calling convention.
When a floating-point argument narrower than FLEN bits is passed in a
floating-point register, it is 1-extended (NaN-boxed) to FLEN bits.

A struct containing just one floating-point real is passed as though it were
a standalone floating-point real.

A struct containing two floating-point reals is passed in two floating-point
registers, if neither is more than FLEN bits wide and at least two floating-point
argument registers are available.  (The registers need not be an aligned pair.)
Otherwise, it is passed according to the integer calling convention.

A complex floating-point number, or a struct containing just one complex
floating-point number, is passed as though it were a struct containing two
floating-point reals.

A struct containing one floating-point real and one integer (or bitfield), in
either order, is passed in a floating-point register and an integer register,
without extending the integer to XLEN bits, provided the floating-point real
is no more than FLEN bits wide and the integer is no more than XLEN bits wide,
and at least one floating-point argument register and at least one integer
argument register is available. Otherwise, it is passed according to the
integer calling convention.

Unions are never flattened and are always passed according to the integer
calling convention.

Values are returned in the same manner as a first named argument of the same
type would be passed.

Floating-point registers fs0-fs11 shall be preserved across procedure calls,
provided they hold values no more than FLEN bits wide.

=== ILP32E Calling Convention

The ILP32E calling convention is designed to be usable with the RV32E ISA. This
calling convention is the same as the integer calling convention, except for the
following differences.  The stack pointer need only be aligned to a 32-bit
boundary.  Registers x16-x31 do not participate in the calling convention, so
there are only six argument registers, a0-a5, only two callee-saved registers,
s0-s1, and only three temporaries, t0-t2.

If used with an ISA that has any of the registers x16-x31 and f0-f31, then
these registers are considered temporaries.

The ILP32E calling convention is not compatible with ISAs that have registers
that require load and store alignments of more than 32 bits. In particular, this
calling convention must not be used with the D ISA extension.

=== Vector Calling Convention

The vector calling convention provides sixteen argument registers, v8-v23, for
passing vector values and one mask register, v0, for passing mask values.
v8-v15 are also used to return values. How many vector registers will be used as
the return value is depended on LMUL value of the return type. v0 is a special
register for the mask in masked vector instructions. That is why passing the first
mask value into v0. It avoids one vector register copy from v8-v23 to v0.

Vectors that are LMUL = 1 or fractional LMUL are passed in a single vector
argument register. Vectors that are LMUL = 2 are passed in 2-aligned vector
argument registers. Vectors that are LMUL = 4 are passed in 4-aligned vector
argument registers. Vectors that are LMUL = 8 are passed in 8-aligned vector
argument registers. If there is no available vector registers, vectors are
passed by reference. If there are mask type arguments, the first mask type
argument is passed in v0. The remaining mask type arguments follow the rule for
general vector arguments. The mask type argument occupies a single vector
register regardless how many bits are effective in the mask. If there is no
available vector registers for the mask type arguments, mask type arguments are
passed by reference. The value of mask type arguments occupy VLEN bits on the
stack aligned to one byte. If vector values are passed by reference, vector
values are stored on the stack aligned to the size of the elements in the vector.
The addresses of the vector or mask values on the stack are passed according
to the integer calling convention.

The vector in V-extension is scalable vector. What the scalable vector means is
the vector length is unknown for the compiler. Structs could not contain
scalable vectors. The maximum possible value for V-extension is LMUL = 8 vector.
If users use the scalable vector as the container for fixed-length vector, the
maximum possible container type is LMUL = 8 vector. To define the behavior for
LMUL = 1, 2, 4, 8 is enough for the V-extension.

v0-v31, vl, and vtype shall not be preserved across procedure calls.

There is no scalar values passed through vector registers. There is no vector
values passed through scalar registers. There is no need to define a new ABI
for vector. Vector calling convention is appliable for existing ABIs.

=== Named ABIs

This specification defines the following named ABIs:

[[abi-ilp32]]
ILP32:: Integer calling-convention only, hardware
floating-point calling convention is not used (i.e. ELFCLASS32 and
EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_SOFT).

[[abi-ilp32f]]
ILP32F:: ILP32 with hardware floating-point calling
convention for FLEN=32 (i.e. ELFCLASS32 and EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_SINGLE).

[[abi-ilp32d]]
ILP32D:: ILP32 with hardware floating-point calling
convention for FLEN=64 (i.e. ELFCLASS32 and EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_DOUBLE).

[[abi-ilp32e]]
ILP32E:: <<ILP32E Calling Convention,ILP32E calling-convention>> only,
hardware floating-point calling convention is not used (i.e. ELFCLASS32,
EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_SOFT, and EF_RISCV_RVE).

[[abi-lp64]]
LP64:: Integer calling-convention only, hardware
floating-point calling convention is not used (i.e. ELFCLASS64 and
EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_SOFT).

[[abi-lp64f]]
LP64F:: LP64 with hardware floating-point calling
convention for FLEN=32 (i.e. ELFCLASS64 and EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_SINGLE).

[[abi-lp64d]]
LP64D:: LP64 with hardware floating-point calling
convention for FLEN=64 (i.e. ELFCLASS64 and EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_DOUBLE).

[[abi-lp64q]]
LP64Q:: LP64 with hardware floating-point calling
convention for FLEN=128 (i.e. ELFCLASS64 and EF_RISCV_FLOAT_ABI_QUAD).

The ILP32* ABIs are only compatible with RV32* ISAs, and the LP64* ABIs are
only compatible with RV64* ISAs. A future version of this specification may
define an ILP32 ABI for the RV64 ISA, but currently this is not a supported
operating mode.

The *F ABIs require the *F ISA extension, the *D ABIs require the *D ISA
extension, and the LP64Q ABI requires the Q ISA extension.

NOTE: This means code targeting the Zfinx extension always uses the ILP32,
ILP32E or LP64 integer calling-convention only ABIs as there is no dedicated
hardware floating-point register file.

=== Default ABIs

While various different ABIs are technically possible, for software
compatibility reasons it is strongly recommended to use the following
default ABIs for specific architectures:

[horizontal]
on RV32G:: <<abi-ilp32d,ILP32D>>
on RV64G:: <<abi-lp64d,LP64D>>

NOTE: Although RV64GQ systems can technically use <<abi-lp64q,LP64Q>>, it is
strongly recommended to use LP64D on general-purpose RV64GQ systems for
compatibility with standard RV64G software.

== C/C++ type details

=== C/C++ type sizes and alignments

There are two conventions for C/C++ type sizes and alignments.

ILP32, ILP32F, ILP32D, and ILP32E:: Use the following type sizes and
alignments (based on the ILP32 convention):

|===

The alignment of `max_align_t` is 16.

`CHAR_BIT` is 8.

Structs and unions are aligned to the alignment of their most strictly aligned
member. The size of any object is a multiple of its alignment.

=== C/C++ type representations

`char` is unsigned.

Booleans (`bool`/`_Bool`) stored in memory or when being passed as scalar
arguments are either `0` (`false`) or `1` (`true`).

A null pointer (for all types) has the value zero.

`_Float16` is as defined in the C ISO/IEC TS 18661-3 extension.

`_Complex` types have the same layout as a struct containing two fields of the
corresponding real type (`float`, `double`, or `long double`), with the first
member holding the real part and the second member holding the imaginary part.

=== va_list, va_start, and va_arg

The `va_list` type is `void*`. A callee with variadic arguments is responsible
for copying the contents of registers used to pass variadic arguments to the
vararg save area, which must be contiguous with arguments passed on the stack.
The `va_start` macro initializes its `va_list` argument to point to the start
of the vararg save area.  The `va_arg` macro will increment its `va_list`
argument according to the size of the given type, taking into account the
rules about 2×XLEN aligned arguments being passed in "aligned" register pairs.

[appendix]
== Linux-specific ABI

NOTE: This section of the RISC-V calling convention specification only applies
to Linux-based systems.

In order to ensure compatibility between different implementations of the C
library for Linux, we provide some extra definitions which only apply on those
systems. These are noted in this section.

=== Linux-specific C type sizes and alignments

The following definitions apply for all ABIs defined in this document. Here
there is no differentiation between ILP32 and LP64 abis.
